Late trains!
==========================

It puts the "fun" in "The UK's dysfunctional rail system"

* This project is NOT FINISHED. Feel free to contribute if you know React!

The idea is: You bet points on your train being late. If it is late, you WIN!

The thrill of winning worthless internet points (We all love 'em!) will help to numb the harsh reality of the fact that you just missed that important job interview, funeral or first born's delivery. 

Using real train data, the game will reward you more heavily for betting on trains which usually actually manage to crawl into the station on time, with less points awarded for those trains which have had more delays than I've had hot dinners. I've had a lot of hot dinners.
